# Bilkent Tourism Agency System

## Overview
This repository contains a **C++ console application** developed to simulate the operations of a tourism agency. The project was built to demonstrate proficiency in **low-level memory management** and **custom data structure implementation** without relying on high-level STL containers (like `std::vector` or `std::list`).

## Features
* **Custom Linked Lists:** Implemented Singly/Doubly Linked Lists from scratch to handle dynamic client and booking data.
* **Agency Operations:** Functionality to add/remove clients, book holiday packages, and manage quotas.
* **Memory Safety:** Strict management of pointers and dynamic memory allocation/deallocation to prevent memory leaks.
* **Efficient Querying:** Algorithms to search and filter clients based on specific criteria.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** C++ (Standard 11/17)
* **Core Concepts:** Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures.
